Banner Program Title: Performing Arts in Education Center
Banner Program Description: From day one of HCAEF, the need for a performing arts
  space in the community has been recognized. Over the past few years, the idea has
  been explored in greater detail. A Symposium was held in 2016, bringing together
  community members and various experts to begin to lay out a vision. Several architectural
  concepts have been drawn up, and we continue to move forward with making this dream
  a reality.
