About Us Text: We strongly believe that every child deserves the opportunity to expand

Our History Title: Our History
Our History Text: "Harney County Arts in Education Foundation (HCAEF) officially became
  a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization in 2009. It was founded after millions of dollars
  in budget cuts were made to the local school districts, with devastating results.
  Music and art classes ended at Burns High School, Hines Middle School, Slater Elementary,
  Crane Elementary, and Crane High School. \n\nThe dedicated volunteers that stepped
  forward to make a difference for our youth have kept our mission. In the six years
  after its founding, HCAEF raised over $55,000 to support the music and arts programs
  in Harney County. The band program instructor was fully funded; art programs at
  Burns High School and Crane High School were restored, and funding helped assist
  programs at rural schools (Diamond, Frenchglen, and Double O). Artists-in-Residence
  programs were established at the schools."
