About Us Intro: Our mission is to promote, maintain, and enhance the opportunities
  for growth and achievement within the areas of Music Education, Performing Arts,
  Visual Arts, and Theater Arts in the schools and communities of Harney County.
About Us Text: We strongly believe that every child deserves the opportunity to expand
  their horizons from the exposure to, appreciation and performance of music and the
  arts. There is no question that this type of education benefits at-risk kids, opens
  doors of opportunity to dedicated students and increases academic ability for all.

Our History Title: Our History
Our History Text: "Harney County Arts in Education Foundation (HCAEF) officially became
  a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization in 2009. It was founded after millions of dollars
  in budget cuts were made to the local school districts, with devastating results.
  Music and art classes ended at Burns High School, Hines Middle School, Slater Elementary,
  Crane Elementary, and Crane High School. \n\nThe dedicated volunteers that stepped
  forward to make a difference for our youth have kept our mission. In the six years
  after its founding, HCAEF raised over $55,000 to support the music and arts programs
  in Harney County. The band program instructor was fully funded; art programs at
  Burns High School and Crane High School were restored, and funding helped assist
  programs at rural schools (Diamond, Frenchglen, and Double O). Artists-in-Residence
  programs were established at the schools."
