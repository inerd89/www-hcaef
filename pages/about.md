  **Why We Do What We Do**

  We strongly believe that every child deserves the opportunity to expand their horizons from the exposure to, appreciation and performance of music and the arts. There is no question that this type of education benefits at-risk kids, opens doors of opportunity to dedicated students and increases academic ability for all.

Our History Text: "**Our History**\n\nHarney County Arts in Education Foundation (HCAEF)
  officially became a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization in 2009. It was founded after
  millions of dollars in budget cuts were made to the local school districts, with
  devastating results. Music and art classes ended at Burns High School, Hines Middle
  School, Slater Elementary, Crane Elementary, and Crane High School. \n\nThe dedicated
  volunteers that stepped forward to make a difference for our youth have kept our
  mission. In the six years after its founding, HCAEF raised over $55,000 to support
  the music and arts programs in Harney County. The band program instructor was fully
  funded; art programs at Burns High School and Crane High School were restored, and
  funding helped assist programs at rural schools (Diamond, Frenchglen, and Double
  O). Artists-in-Residence programs were established at the schools."
