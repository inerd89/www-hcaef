n October 2014, my father was startled to receive a letter announcing the retirement, in a month’s time, of our family physician. Both he and his doctor were in their late 60s by then, and their relationship went back about 30 years, to the early 1980s, after my father followed his father and paternal grandparents, all from the Midwest, to Southwest Florida. How they began seeing the doctor is beyond memory, but as my father’s grandparents grew increasingly frail, his father frequently drove them to their doctor for checkups. At one of them, in the mid-’80s, the doctor suggested that it might be less strenuous for my great-grandparents if he met them in the parking lot. From then until they died, he came downstairs from his seventh-floor office with his black bag and climbed into the back seat of their yellow Oldsmobile 88 to give them their physicals.

> More than a decade later, my grandfather, who was 78 by then and had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, developed pneumonia. When he was admitted to the county hospital, it was the same doctor — now my doctor, too — who came to his room to describe his options: go on a ventilator and go home, where he would most likely remain bedridden for the remainder of his life (probably months), or let the illness run its course and die within a few days. My grandfather asked if the latter would hurt much. The doctor said no, he could make him comfortable. All right, then, my grandfather replied.

By the time the doctor abruptly tendered his retirement notice, I had long since moved away. I had lived with high-deductible health insurance for years and, after a few surprise bills I could not afford, I avoided medical professionals whenever possible. Often, when I didn’t have a primary-care physician or couldn’t remember his or her name (which changed with my ever-changing insurance policy), I filled out forms with my hometown doctor’s name instead: George P. Fitzgerald III, M.D. But until my father told me about his letter, I had not reflected on his role in my life. I’d rarely seen him more than once a year, and any problems I did have were unremarkable, easily treatable by someone else. And yet his departure felt like a loss.

My father, after his final checkup, reported why the doctor was leaving: He objected to the increasing industrialization of medical care, in particular a new Medicare mandate that he update patients’ medical histories electronically — not because he was old-fashioned or contrary (though he was both), but because the idea of dividing his attention between a computer screen and a patient offended him. This shift to electronic health records, intended to improve communication between a patient’s various physicians as well as “automate and streamline provider workflow,” was the latest in a series of incentives that the health-insurance market created over the past 20 years to maximize efficiency. In this payment system, the time-consuming process of cultivating a relationship with a patient is essentially worthless, because doing so is not a finite, billable procedure. For the doctor, however, the fourth generation of his family to practice medicine, it was vital to his craft.
