Hello my name is Janine Goodwin, but my students know me as Ms. O'Del. 

I recently completed the work to get my teaching license reinstated and get a music endorsement. This year, TSPC and EOU require me to get an elementary endorsement as well. I am currently taking Elementary and PE Methods, and I have to take four 3-credit graduate courses in the fall of 2020: 
EDU 625, Early Literacy Foundations Methods
MTHE 627, Elementary Mathematics Methods
EDU 631, Elementary Reading Methods
EDU 623, Exceptionalities
The total tuition cost is $5850, not counting textbooks,  which is a heavy burden. The generous scholarship from the Foundation will cover one course and some of the books for that course. 

I am deeply grateful for the support of the Foundation, both for myself and for the music program at Slater, and I hope to continue working to deserve your faith in me for years to come.

Janine
