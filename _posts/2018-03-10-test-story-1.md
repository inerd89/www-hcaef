*Jan. 23, 2013*

The Harney County Arts in Education Foundation (HCAEF) has been awarded a $10,000 grant from the Fred W. Fields Fund of the Oregon Community Foundation.

Earlier this year, Fred Fields left a substantial gift to the Oregon Community Foundation (OCF) with the direction to use the permanent fund to support education and the arts in Oregon. The size and nature of his gift are extraordinary, and OCFâ€™s board is excited to make its first round of grants from the fund. More than $1 million in unsolicited, one-time grants are being awarded to nonprofits such as the HCAEF for the good work being accomplished in areas that were meaningful to Fred and Suzanne Fields.

Special recognition goes to the efforts of Teri Cain and Phil Kessinger for their contacts with OCF, promoting the HCAEF and establishing awareness at the state level.

HCAEF continues its support of art and music education for Crane and Burns high schools, Hines Middle School and Slater Elementary. They remain committed to the excellence of an arts education for our youth and are moving forward to accomplish the vision of a performing arts and education center for Harney County.
